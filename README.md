Open, bottom-up distribution requests

## Problem statement

Manufacturers and suppliers may have stock but lack oversight of where it is needed.

Frontline staff should be able to highlight needs and make requests in a bottom-up
way which might be supplied by smaller purchase orders to complement top-down 
logistics.
